  # you can rename it, or remove it. But you must create a message with jarvis::Message::Message.new

  	# To communicate with Jarvis, you've to send him a message like this :
  	# Jarvis::Messages::Message.new('<%= @infos[:specs]['name'] %>', 'Hello Jarvis!', object)
  	# object is not required, but I'm pretty sure you receive a message, or you can build
  	# one. This object is used by receivers to read some useful data. For example,
  	# you can send an tweet object, and the receiver will know who tweet it, the message,
  	# and the creation date.
