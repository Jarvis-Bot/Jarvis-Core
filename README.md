Jarvis [Draft]
=========================== 

## What is it ?

**Jarvis** is a bot for twitter. I craft it to become my assistant. It's perfect to run on your own server.
You could say "@NAMEBOT download http://fake.link/" and it will be downloaded in your specific folder.

## Examples

	@NAMEBOT : uptime                      => 6 days, 4 hours, 3 minutes and 45 seconds
	@NAMEBOT : alarm 6:15                  => Alarm set to 6:15
	@NAMEBOT : next birthday               => Steve Adam will be the next one, on 7th october !
	@NAMEBOT : reminder buy milk @ 18:00   => I will remind you to buy milk at 18:00

## Plugins 

You'll be able to create your own Plugins. I'm still thinking about the architecture. It should be really simple for you, developpers.
